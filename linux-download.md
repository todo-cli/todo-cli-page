## Direct executables

If your Linux distribution is not Debian based (e.g. Ubuntu) or if you prefer to use the executables directly.

### Steps
1.  Download the [latest](https://github.com/cmhteixeira/todo-list/releases/download/v0.1.0/todo-cli_0.1.0_amd64.deb) executable.
2.  Move it to any path of your choice.
3.  Make sure the executable file is indeed _executable_. If not, run `sudo chmod +x <the-executable>`.   
3.  Add said path to the PATH variable. Normally you will add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file.  
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/the/parent/folder/where/the/executable/is/at
```
